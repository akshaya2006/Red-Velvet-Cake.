How to make Red Velvet Cake step by step...


step1.  first preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C). Next let's make our cake batter . Start by creaming your butter and white granulated or cater suger together in a large bowl . Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this.

step2.  Now we add in our eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in, mix once that egg is completly incorporated do the other egg. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as well with a spatula.

step3.  Now we add in our cocoa powder. It is a good idea to run it through some kind of a sifter. Cocoa powder tends toget a bit lumpy. Then mix again and scrape the sides as needed. Throughout this whole process we don't want to over mix, just untill things are incorporated. If we mix too much we will add too much air into the butter which can cause air pockets in our cake.

step4.  Now add in your vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vineger. If you don't have butter you can makesome by taking just shy of one of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vineger and then lrt it sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegerand vanilla extract untill combined.

step5.  Now we add in our oil to the buttermilk mixture. Next add in about 2 to 2 and 1/2 Tablespoones of red food colouring liquid. Tthen stir, untill the mixture is a nice red color. Set that mixture aside for now.

step6.  Next we will add our salt and baking soda to our flour. You can use cake flour or all-purpose flour. Cake flour trends to work a little bit better, but all-purpose works greate too. Use a which to combine those ingrediants.

step7.  Next we will add in about half of our food colouring buttermilk mixture and about half of our flour mixture, then turn on the mixture and mix untill just combined. Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the process untill all the ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet cake batter.

step8.  Now we just fill up two 9 inch cake pans with equal amounts of cake batter. Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pans and then dust then withcocoa powder or flour and I always add a ltitle round cut out of parchment paper on the bottom too as an added precautions, and my nonstick pans are great, but I like to over-do it. lol Also it is a good idea to lightly tap the pans with the batterinit, this will allow any cake bubbles to rise to the top, which helps to prevent air pockets, but sometimes it is unavoidable and you just get them, a combination of over mixing, ect. But it won't effect the taste of the cake for 23 to 30 minutes untill when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.

step9.  Now after the cakes come out of the oven let's leave then alone and allow then to cool in thier pans for about 10 minutes, After that we can remove then from their pans, remove the parchment paper and then let the cakes cool  completly on the rack. Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let them cill, which helps with the frosting, or just go onto the frosting step now, it's totally up to you!

step10.  Well now it is time to make our frosting , we will be using just a few ingredients, cream cheese, butter vanilla extract, and of course powdered sugar (confectioner's suger).

step11.  Now combine the creame cheese, butter and vanilla extract into a largr bowl and mix a hand mixer until nice and smooth usually takes a few minutes. You may need more or less depending on the constistency that you want. Next just remove the beaters. Frosting is ready to go. At this point if the frosting is still too rurny add more powdered sugar, or just chill it for about10 minutes before frosting that cake.

step12.  fisrt we will trip the cake so it will be somewhat level. You can skip this stop if you like. I just always use my bread knife to cut the top off of the bottom layer, if you want to use fondent I recommend cutting the top of the top layer off as well, the end product will look a bit better. Next add alunch of frosting to the middle, then layer the top layer of the cake on. Then cover that wholecake with frosting. There are a variety of tools that you can use, I normally just use my cake spatula. Once done put the cake in the fridge for about so minutes. This is optional, but i like to do it, allows the frosting to set a bit.

step13.  Now I want to make a heart-shaped cake topper. To do that i take my heart cookie and cut out a shape from the middle of that peice of cake that I have. Then just place it on top of your cake, Looks pretty neat right?

Step14. Now take the rest of your leftover cake and crumble it with your fingers. Then gently apply it do your cake slider or on top or skip this step. It is totally up to you how you decorate your cake. :) Use a piping bag and pipe frosting around the top of your heart if you like. You are done! Now place the cake in the fridge for about 2 hours before serving. Enjoy!
